### Hello World :earth_africa:,
I am [Riccardo](https://www.riccardocadei.com/) :it:, a Research Fellow at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) conducting research in Causal Machine Learning. 
In July 2020, I graduated (BSc) in Mathematical Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.mate.polimi.it/im/), and in March 2023 I graduated (MSc) in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/) after several internships, in both industry and academia, and a 6-months visiting period at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) for my Master's Thesis.

Here you can find a collection of different problems, challenges and frameworks regarding:
- Machine Learning :chart_with_upwards_trend:, 
- Optimization :dart:,
- Statistics :bar_chart:,
- Causal Inference :interrobang:,

that I have solved and implemented during the last few years :calendar: and I can share publicly :unlock:.

For a better organization of all the projects see: [MY PORTFOLIO](https://www.riccardocadei.com/projects/) :file_folder:

Don't hesitate to contact me at `riccardo.cadei@epfl.ch` :mailbox: if you are interested in a specific project. 


Enjoy the reading! :book:
