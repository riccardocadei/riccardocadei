### Hello World :earth_africa:,
I am [Riccardo](https://www.riccardocadei.com/) :it:, an enthusiastic researcher at [Causal Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/locatello-group/) advised by [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/) ([**ISTA**](https://ista.ac.at/home)) and co-advised by [Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en) ([**Google Research**](https://research.google/)). 

<!--Through my research, I aim to scale Causal Representation Learning to real-world applications to (i) shed new light on some of the most important open challenges in Artificial Intelligence --i.e., Robustness, Transferability, and Fairness-- and (ii) directly answer to causal tasks on unstructured data with positive and direct impact on public health.

In July 2020, I graduated (BSc) in Mathematical Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.mate.polimi.it/im/), and in March 2023 I graduated (MSc) in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/) after 3 internships, in both industry and academia, several research experiences and a visiting period at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) for my Master's Thesis, where I was following hired as a research fellow. -->

Here you can find a collection of different packages, challenges and problems regarding:
- Machine Learning :chart_with_upwards_trend:, 
- Optimization :dart:,
- Statistics :bar_chart:,
- Causal Inference :interrobang:,

that I have solved and implemented during the last few years and I can share publicly ðŸ”“.

For a ordered archive of these projects see: [MY PORTFOLIO](https://www.riccardocadei.com/projects/) :file_folder: and don't hesitate to reach out at `riccardo.cadei98@gmail.com` :mailbox: for any constructive discussion.

Enjoy the reading! :book:
